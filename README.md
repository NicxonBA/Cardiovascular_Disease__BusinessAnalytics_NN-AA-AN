In this project, a model was developed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases using a dataset of patients with 18 predictor variables related to their health, habits, and demographic data, along with a response variable indicating whether or not the patient suffered from heart disease.
In this project, a model was developed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases using a dataset that includes 18 predictor variables related to patients' health, habits, and demographic information. The response variable indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with heart disease. Data manipulation was performed, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), which allowed for cleaning and transforming the dataset, identifying patterns, and addressing issues such as class imbalance.

Two machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees, were implemented to train the model and make predictions. During the process, techniques were applied to handle the imbalanced data and improve the model's accuracy. Additionally, model performance was evaluated by identifying the most relevant variables for predicting cardiovascular diseases and analyzing the errors made by the models.

The project also included an evaluation of the costs associated with implementing an AdaBoost-type model in a hospital in Ecuador, considering the required personnel, computational infrastructure, and cloud services necessary for processing large volumes of data. However, the main focus was on the development and validation of the predictive models, with a detailed analysis of the variables and the performance of the algorithms used.
